# MMAI Capstone Project

A reproducible notebook-driven project exploring a real-world ML/NLP/analytics problem (MMAI program capstone).  
**Status:** in progress • **Primary artifact:** `Capstone_Project_0811.ipynb`

## Objectives
- Clearly define the business/problem statement
- Explore and prepare data
- Build baseline and improved models
- Evaluate with appropriate metrics
- Share insights and next steps

## Repository Structure

> Create `data/` and `figures/` locally; they are not committed.

## Quick Start
1. **Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lucy-wo/MMAICapstoneProject.git
   cd MMAICapstoneProject
````

2. **Environment** (example)

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -U pip
   # Add/adjust as needed:
   pip install jupyter pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn ipywidgets
   ```
3. **Run the notebook**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Capstone_Project_0811.ipynb
   ```

## Data

* **Source:** *Describe where the data comes from (public dataset, internal export, etc.).*
* **Access:** Data is not included in the repo. Place files under `data/` and update paths in the notebook.

## Methodology (at a glance)

* Problem framing and KPI/metric selection
* EDA: missingness, distributions, leakage checks
* Feature engineering & preprocessing pipeline
* Baseline model → tuned/regularized model(s)
* Validation: CV strategy, holdout set, error analysis

## Results

* *Summarize key findings and metrics (e.g., ROC-AUC, RMSE, F1).*
* *Include representative plots from `figures/`.*

## How to Reproduce

* Environment details and versions are captured in the notebook.
* Re-run all cells top-to-bottom after placing data in `data/`.

## Roadmap

* [ ] Add `requirements.txt` / `environment.yml`
* [ ] Parameterize data paths; move constants to a config cell
* [ ] Export final model artifacts and inference example
* [ ] Write unit tests for feature functions (optional)
